# Convurs-Bot
My Python Pro Course graduation project. Used for classification images 🔎🖼️

🗣️: "Which classification images are you referring to?"

- This project classifies fish images based on their habitat, diet, and safety for human consumption 🐟⚠️
- There are three types of fish that can be classified (labels.txt): Koi, mujair (tilapia), and clown fish
- This is a revision of my old Discord bot code, so you may notice some off-topic commands 🤷🏽‍♂️
